# Cookie Clicker in Nextjs Workshop

My personal 2-4 hour Cookie Clicker workshop template designed for intermediate Nextjs developers to learn a few things about React's `useContext()` in Nextjs web applications.

This was built for a workshop I hosted on `March 13, 2024 (4-6pm CDT)` for MLH's Global Hack Week: Games (2024).

## Getting Started

Install dependencies using:

```bash
npm install
```

After, run the development server using:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Once running, open and play cookie clicker at: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
# cookieclicka
